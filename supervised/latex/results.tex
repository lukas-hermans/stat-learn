- explain procedure
1. subset selection: find most suitable $m$ for all machine learning techniques
2. find best hyperparameters for best $m$
3. comparison of all machine learning algorithms

\subsection{Majority Predictor}
- CV accuracy and test accuracy constant for all $m$ (in general, different)
- take majority predictor as a reference for the performance of the other prediction algorithms
- figure: accuracy vs. $m$
- state test accuracy for best 
- table: confusion matrix

\subsection{Logistic Regression}
