The following list gives an overview of the software that is used to develop the binary classification dataset and to implement the machine learning algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\item R (version 3.6.3): development of dataset \& implementation of logistic regression and K-nearest neighbors algorithm
\item RStudio (version 1.4.1717): IDE for R coding
\item Python (version 3.7.10): implementation of deep neural network
\item Anaconda (version 4.10.1): managing of Python modules
\item Tensorflow (version 2.4.1): Python module for machine learning, especially deep learning
\end{itemize}

All R and Python code, the dataset, and the \LaTeX-code of this paper can be found in the following GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/lukher98/stat-learn}. The relevant folder for the present work is called \enquote{supervised}. In particular, the folder \enquote{data} contains the raw data obtained from the Blockchain.com API, the time series dataset (\enquote{data.csv}), and the binary classification dataset (\enquote{m=100.csv}).\\ 

All of the code was executed on a Linux machine, but it should also work on a Mac machine. For Windows, the user might have to change some path names inside the code.
