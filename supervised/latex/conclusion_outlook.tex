The starting point of the present work is the development of a binary classification dataset that can be applied to train supervised machine learning algorithms for the prediction of tomorrow's Bitcoin market price development. The labels in the binary classification dataset take two possible classes \enquote{up} and \enquote{down} that specify if the Bitcoin market price of tomorrow is increasing or decreasing. The features are the past development of the Bitcoin market price and related measures like the miner's revenue.\\

Four different algorithms are trained on the binary classification dataset. A simple majority predictor - that always predicts an increasing Bitcoin market price - leads to a prediction accuracy of \SI{55.54}{\percent}, combined with a sensitivity of \SI{100}{\percent} and a specificity of \SI{0}{\percent}. A variety of deep neural network architectures appear to be naive majority predictors with the same results. The application of neural networks like long short-term memory networks that are more adequate for time series forecasting applications could improve these results. The highest prediction accuracy of \SI{56.70}{\percent} is obtained with a logistic regression fit, though a logistic regression does not coincide with the true underlying model of the binary classification dataset. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm leads to the lowest prediction accuracy of \SI{51.80}{\percent}. Both the logistic regression fit and the K-nearest neighbors algorithm have non-zero specificities at the cost of lower sensitivities compared to the majority predictor.\\

An improvement of the prediction performance is possible by including more features like social media data and Google searches, and by the application of algorithms that are specialized for the application on time series forecasting problems.\\

All in all, the present work shows that the prediction of the future Bitcoin market price development can be treated as a supervised learning task.
