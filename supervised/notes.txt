Overall question: How many days in the future can we predict the Bitcoin price development?

Introduction: 
- explanation of Bitcoin [Nakamoto]
- so far classification showed reasonable accuracy of about 50 %
- content structure

Data Set & Predictors:
- predictors: prices from Bitstamp (https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/data/bitstamp/), transaction number (https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&format=json), non-classical: blocksize, difficulty, fees, miner revenue, hashrate
- many other predictors possible (e.g., Twitter sentiment, Google searches, etc...) [Cerda, Matta]
- standardization of data
- bring data into correct form (some part of history + some part of future)
- presentation of data
- goal: predict bitcoin price based on certain part of history

Prediction Algorithms:
- GAM
- Neural Network

Results:

Discussion:


Conclusion & Outlook: 
- integrate other predictors (like those mentioned above)
- implement regression to predict actual price
- develop investment strategy
