# Statistical Learning

This repository contains the data and code that is used for two university projects on supervised and unsupervised learning. The structure of this repository with its two folders "supervised" and "unsupervised" should be self-explanatory. For more information on the corresponding university course, see [here](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/insegnamenti-dei-corsi-di-laurea/2021/machine-learning-statistical-learning-deep-learning-and-artificial-intelligence).
