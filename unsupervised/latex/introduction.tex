Text mining and unsupervised clustering techniques are important tools for the profiling of social media users. The insights from the application of these techniques are essential in a variety of fields. Among these are the maximization of returns via the personalization of advertisements, the analysis of the home locations of users, and the social sciences, where - for instance - the popularity of politicians is infered from social media posts \cite{advertisement_2016}\cite{home_2012}\cite{socialscience_2018}. \\

The scope of the present work is to prove the applicability of text mining and unsupervised clustering techniques for the profiling of Twitter users. Twitter is a social media platform that was introduced in 2006 by Jack Dorsey \cite{twitter}. The analysis is focused on Elon Musk - the CEO and founder of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and several other companies \cite{musk_2015}. The applied unsupervised clustering techniques are K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. In general, these unsupervised approaches are difficult to evaluate as there are no labels like for supervised machine learning tasks. The idea of the present work is that the focus on a public person like Elon Musk, however, allows to compare the obtained insights about the Twitter user with an expectation as Elon Musk is not an unkown person. \\

The structure of the present work is as follows. Section~\ref{sec:dataset} describes the dataset that contains the Tweets of Elon Musk and related information. First insights are gained by an exploratory data analysis. The applied clustering techniques are described in Section~\ref{sec:theory}, while the details of their implementation are covered by Section~\ref{sec:implementation_software}. Section~\ref{sec:results} presents the results of the application of the unsupervised clustering techniques on the Tweet dataset. In Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, the insights from the exploratory data analysis and the application of the unsupervised clustering techniques are combined, and compared with the general knowledge about Elon Musk. Finally, a summary of the present work is given in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
