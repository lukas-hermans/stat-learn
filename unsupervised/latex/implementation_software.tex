The unsupervised clusering algorithms in the present work are implemented in the programming language R (version 3.6.3). As IDE RStudio (version 1.4.1717) is used. All R code, the dataset, and the \LaTeX-code of the present paper can be found in the following GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/lukher98/stat-learn}. For the present work, the folder \enquote{unsupervised} is relevant. The subfolder \enquote{data} contains the original dataset from Kaggle (\enquote{tweets\_musk.csv}) as well as the preprocessed Tweets (\enquote{tweets\_clean.csv}).\\

All of the code was executed on a Linux machine, but it should also work on a Mac machine. For Windows, the user might have to change some path names inside the code.
